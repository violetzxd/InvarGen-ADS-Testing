You are an expert Autonomous Driving System (ADS) safety analyst and a formal verification specialist. Your task is to meticulously analyze multi-modal accident data to understand the underlying causes and identify critical "scenario fixed points" that characterize the safety-critical states involved.

**Input Data:**
- **Primary:** A sequence of video frames and/or key images depicting an ADS-involved traffic accident.
- **Secondary (if available):** Accompanying textual accident reports, sensor logs, or eyewitness accounts.

**Analysis Steps - Perform these sequentially and thoroughly:**

**Step 1: Multi-modal Scene Interpretation and Entity Recognition**
- Analyze the visual data (video/images) to identify and precisely track all dynamic traffic participants (e.g., `Ego Vehicle`, `NPC_Car_1`, `Pedestrian_1`, `Motorcycle_1`, `Cyclist_1`), and static environmental elements (e.g., `Road_Type` (e.g., Highway, Urban, Intersection), `Lane_Markings`, `Traffic_Signals` (id, position), `Road_Hazards`, `Weather_Conditions` (e.g., clear, rain, fog), `Lighting_Conditions` (e.g., day, night, dusk/dawn, glare)).
- For each identified entity, track its state variables over time: `position (x, y, z)`, `speed (m/s)`, `acceleration (m/s^2)`, `heading (degrees)`, `yaw_rate (deg/s)`, `lateral_offset_from_lane_center (m)`.

**Step 2: Behavioral Analysis and Intent Inference**
- For each dynamic participant, analyze their trajectories and state changes to infer their driving behaviors and underlying intentions.
- **Examples:**
    - `NPC_Car_1` performs `SuddenBraking` (infer `aggressive_braking_intent`).
    - `NPC_Car_2` performs `AbruptLaneChange` (infer `aggressive_lane_change_intent`).
    - `Ego Vehicle` exhibits `ExcessiveLateralDeviation` (infer `potential_loss_of_control`).
- Quantify key interaction metrics: `Time-To-Collision (TTC)`, `Minimum Headway Distance (MHD)`.
- Identify sensory conditions: `sensor_occlusion`, `sensor_noise`, `data_quality`.

**Step 3: Accident Cause Chain Analysis**
- Based on the observed events and inferred behaviors, reconstruct the causal chain that led to the accident or near-accident. Identify the initiating event(s) and the sequence of interactions.
- **Example output format:**
    ```
    Causal_Chain:
    - Event 1: NPC_Front (Car) at t=5s initiates sudden braking (deceleration=8m/s^2).
    - Event 2: Ego Vehicle's perception/prediction module fails to adequately anticipate braking.
    - Event 3: Ego Vehicle initiates emergency braking at t=5.8s, but too late.
    - Event 4: Ego Vehicle approaches NPC_Front with extremely low TTC (0.5s) at t=6.5s.
    - Outcome: Near-miss / Rear-end collision.
    ```

**Step 4: Fixed Point Conceptualization and Formalized Identification**
- Based on the above analysis, identify and categorize the specific "scenario fixed points" that were involved, violated, or were relevant to the accident/critical situation.
- **Formalize each identified fixed point** into a machine-readable format. Use the provided DSL syntax or logical predicates. Infer necessary parameters (e.g., `tolerance`, `threshold`, `min_distance`, `within_time`) based on typical driving physics, traffic regulations, or severity observed in the accident.

**Fixed Point Types and Formalization Guidance:**

**A. Safety Fixed Points (Invariants of Safe Driving Behavior):**
- **Lane Keeping Fixed Point:**
    - **Description:** ADS maintains a stable position near the lane center.
    - **Formalization:** `INVARIANT_ALWAYS(is_lane_centered(Ego, tolerance=<inferred_tolerance>));`
- **Safe Headway Fixed Point:**
    - **Description:** ADS preserves a predefined safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
    - **Formalization:** `INVARIANT_ALWAYS(distance(Ego, NPC_Front) > <inferred_min_safe_distance>);`
- **Traffic Rule Compliance Fixed Point:**
    - **Description:** ADS fully stops at a red light or stop sign.
    - **Formalization:** `ON_EVENT(traffic_light_state_change("<signal_id>", "RED")) { ASSERT_EVENTUALLY(speed(Ego) == 0.0 AND at_position(Ego, <stop_line_pos>, tolerance=<pos_tolerance>), within_time=<time_limit>); }`

**B. Critical Fixed Points (Unstable states revealing ADS vulnerabilities):**
- **Near-Loss-of-Control Fixed Point:**
    - **Description:** Vehicle attitude/trajectory indicates imminent loss of control (e.g., excessive sideslip, sharp turns).
    - **Formalization:** `INVARIANT_ALWAYS(abs(get_sideslip_angle(Ego)) <= <inferred_max_sideslip_angle>);`
- **Sensor Anomaly Fixed Point:**
    - **Description:** Patterns of abnormal sensor readings (e.g., temporary occlusion, noise interference).
    - **Formalization:** `INVARIANT_ALWAYS(get_sensor_data_quality("<sensor_id>") >= <inferred_min_quality_threshold>);`
- **Near-Collision Interaction Fixed Point:**
    - **Description:** Extremely close interactions between ADS and other vehicles without an actual collision (very low TTC/MHD).
    - **Formalization:** `INVARIANT_ALWAYS(NOT (get_TTC(Ego, <NPC_ID>) <= <inferred_critical_TTC> AND NOT is_collision(Ego, <NPC_ID>)));`

**C. Recovery Fixed Points (Desired safe states ADS should return to after perturbation):**
- **Lane Recovery Fixed Point:**
    - **Description:** ADS successfully returns to its lane after a departure.
    - **Formalization:** `ON_EVENT(lane_deviation_start(Ego)) { ASSERT_EVENTUALLY(is_lane_centered(Ego, tolerance=<inferred_tolerance>), within_time=<time_limit>); }`
- **Safe Distance Recovery Fixed Point:**
    - **Description:** ADS re-establishes a safe headway after emergency braking or other sudden interactions.
    - **Formalization:** `ON_EVENT(emergency_braking_start(Ego)) { ASSERT_EVENTUALLY(distance(Ego, NPC_Front) > <inferred_min_safe_distance>, within_time=<time_limit>); }`
